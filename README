Observations

In the file we download the new line character seems to not be printed correctly. That's the only difference we get between the file downloaded with wget and our program.

High-level approach

In order to implement HTTP we reused the code for project 2.
For TCP and IP, we created classes for the headers and packets of both, and then methods for receiving and sending packets.
First we do the three-way handshake and afterwards we send the connection petition.
Then we receive packets and send ack for those packets, and transfer them to the HTTP layer.
Finally we write the data to a file.

Features implemented

Everything that was asked is implemented

HTTP
-Everything from project 2
-Writing the result to a file

TCP
-Generate correct TCP Headers
-Generate correct checksums
-Verify incoming TCP checksums
-Select valid local port
-Handle seq and ack numbers
-Three way handshake
-Connection teardown
-Handle seq and ack numbers
-Timeout functionality
-Out of order packets
-Duplicated packets
-Advertisement window (fixed size)
-Congestion window (no need to implement complex algorithm since we don't send a lot of messages)

IP
-Generate correct IP Headers
-Generate correct checksums
-Verify incoming IP checksums
-Verify incoming IP address
-Obtain local IP address

---------

Challenges

The most difficult part is the handling of the incoming TCP packets.
